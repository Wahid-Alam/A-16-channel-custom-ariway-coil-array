# 16-channel custom-coil array for UIG (upper and Infra Glottic) airway MRI at 3T
A 16 channel flexible and anatomy conforming coil was developed to provide localized sensitivity over upper and infra glottic airway regions of interest. In this work, imaging capabilities were compared against existing head only, and head neck coils.
