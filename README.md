# Main advantages of the custom airway coil: 
- In contrast to existing head and head-neck coils, the proposed coil is in a light weight, flexible manner allowing for conformation to different face/neck anatomies, and imaging in the lateral recumbent posture.

- Improved SENSE parallel imaging performance for the task of static 3D imaging of the upper airway and infra glottic airway.

- With blinded image quality ratings from two experts, we found that in the supine posture, the proposed coil enabled a net 3-fold acceleration, when accelerated either in the SI or AP direction; and a net 4 fold acceleration when accelerated in both SI and AP directions.
